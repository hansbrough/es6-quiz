      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Here's some basic es6+ syntax questions to quiz your knowledge and determine what areas require some "brushing up".
        These are not questions that ask you to program but rather are meant jog your memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chances are you've looked up similar questions many times in the past while working on a project.
        Ofcourse it's easy to <em>cheat</em> but that defeats the purpose doesn't it?
        Get started to see how much you've kept in memory!
      </p>
      <p>
        The quizzes here are built with the help of the npm 'question-tree-core' package.
